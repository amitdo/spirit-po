TODO
====

- Line numbers in error messages?
- Add support for parsing po content with no header? Just 
  'pasting in' the po content? Allow an empty `catalog` to be
  constructed from a `catalog_metadata` object?
- More testing for contexts / plural forms?
- Add a bytecode for the plural forms function expressions?
- Refactor the catalog metadata header parse function into a
  single `qi` grammar?
- Add more `msgfmt`-style validation? (if one of `msgid`, `msgstr`
  ends with `'\n'` and one does not, give a warning?)
- Allow to detect and omit fuzzy strings?
- Benchmarks?
